# pukeko

## What is it?

A (soon to be partially verified) toy compiler based on SPJ's "The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages".

## What does *pukeko* stand for?

  * First of all, it is the Maori name of the [Australasian swamphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_swamphen). Since O'Reilly books on programming languages tend to have animals on their cover and this bird is a particularly [cute animal](http://www.whitcoulls.co.nz/dq-bag-tag-kids-pukeko-5794815), I consider this name to be a very wise choice.
  
  * Once I've convinced [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) (another bird, heh?) that the translation from pukeko source code to G-machine code is correct, it could be an acronym for **pu**rtially **ke**rtified **ko**mpiler.
  
  * Before then, it should probably mean **pu**orly **ke**rtified **ko**mpiler. (I hope the [cuteness of the pukeko](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=pukeko+drawing&tbm=isch) makes up for the lack of this name being a unique selling point.)

## What's up next?

Changing the **pu**orly into **pu**rtially!
